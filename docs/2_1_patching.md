5. Tap on the **Done** then **Patch** button

   > [!WARNING]  
   > The patching process may take ~5 minutes. Exiting the app may cancel patching or increase the time it takes to patch.
6. Tap on the **Install** button

   > If you are rooted, you can mount the patched app on top of the original app.[^3]
   > Optionally, you may export the patched app to storage using the option in the bottom left corner.

[^1]: Non-root users may be prompted to select an APK from storage, in which case you must source the APK file yourself. ReVanced does not provide any APK files.
[^2]: It is suggested to use the default set of patches by tapping on the **Default** button above the list of patches.
[^3]: Mounting the patched app on top of the original app will only work if the installed app version matches the version of the app selected in step 3. above.
